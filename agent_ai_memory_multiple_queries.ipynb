I\\'ll cover the different methods and give you some tips along the way.\\n\\n**I. Core Components of a Great Pizza:**\\n\\n*   **The Crust:**  This is the foundation. Your choice here dictates much of the process.\\n*   **The Sauce:**  Adds moisture and flavor.\\n*   **The Cheese:**  The melty, bubbly goodness.\\n*   **The Toppings:**  Where you get creative and add your personal touch!\\n\\n**II. Choosing Your Pizza Base:**\\n\\n*   **Pre-Made Crusts (Store-Bought):**\\n    *   **Pros:**  Convenient, quick.\\n    *   **Cons:**  Can be bland, sometimes dry.\\n    *   **Tips:** Look for crusts that are refrigerated rather than shelf-stable; they tend to be higher quality. Some stores even have par-baked crusts that are almost ready to go.\\n*   **Store-Bought Dough:**\\n    *   **Pros:**  Better texture and flavor than pre-made crusts.  Requires some prep but not as much as making your own.\\n    *   **Cons:**  Needs time to rise.\\n    *   **Tips:** Let the dough come to room temperature before stretching.  Look for \"fresh\" dough in the refrigerated section, often near the cheese or deli.\\n*   **Homemade Dough:**\\n    *   **Pros:**  The ultimate control over flavor and texture. Most rewarding!\\n    *   **Cons:**  Most time-consuming.\\n    *   **Tips:**  See section below for a simple dough recipe.\\n\\n**III. Pizza-Making Methods (Step-by-Step):**\\n\\nHere\\'s the general procedure, adapted for each cooking method:\\n\\n1.  **Prepare Your Ingredients:**\\n    *   **Crust:** If using store-bought, take it out of the packaging. If using dough, stretch or roll it to your desired shape and thickness.\\n    *   **Sauce:** Have your sauce ready.\\n    *   **Cheese:** Shred or slice your cheese.\\n    *   **Toppings:** Chop, slice, or prepare any toppings you\\'ll be using.\\n2.  **Preheat:** Preheat your oven or grill to the temperature specified in the instructions below. This is very important!\\n3.  **Assemble:**\\n    *   Lightly brush your crust with olive oil (optional, but it helps with browning).\\n    *   Spread sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a small border for the edge. Don\\'t over-sauce!\\n    *   Sprinkle on a layer of cheese.\\n    *   Add your toppings.\\n    *   Add a final layer of cheese (optional).\\n4.  **Cook:** Place your pizza in the preheated oven or grill and cook according to the instructions for the chosen method below.\\n5.  **Check for Doneness:** The crust should be golden brown, the cheese melted and bubbly, and the toppings cooked.\\n6.  **Rest:** Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\\n\\n**Specific Cooking Methods:**\\n\\n*   **A. Oven (Most Common):**\\n\\n    *   **Temperature:** 450-500°F (230-260°C).  The hotter, the better (within reason for your oven).\\n    *   **Rack Position:** Middle or lower-middle rack.\\n    *   **Cooking Surface:**\\n        *   **Pizza Stone:** Preheat the stone in the oven *while* the oven is preheating. This is crucial.  Slide the assembled pizza onto the hot stone using a pizza peel (or parchment paper).\\n        *   **Pizza Steel:** Similar to a pizza stone, but heats up more quickly and holds heat better.  Also needs preheating.\\n        *   **Baking Sheet:** If you don\\'t have a stone or steel, a baking sheet will work.  You can lightly grease it or use parchment paper.\\n        *   **Pizza Pan (perforated):** These allow for better air circulation and a crispier crust.\\n    *   **Cooking Time:** 10-15 minutes, or until crust is golden and cheese is melted.\\n    *   **Tips:**\\n        *   For a crispier crust, try brushing the edge with olive oil before baking.\\n        *   Watch the pizza closely, especially in the last few minutes, to prevent burning.\\n        *   If the toppings are browning too quickly, you can tent the pizza with foil.\\n*   **B.

This is crucial for proper testing.\\n* **Parameterized Width:**  The `counter` module uses a `parameter WIDTH = 8` so you can easily change the counter\\'s bit width without modifying the code extensively. This is good design practice.\\n* **`always_ff` Block:** The sequential logic is implemented using an `always_ff` block, triggered by the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) and the positive edge of the reset (`posedge rst`).  This is the correct way to model flip-flops in SystemVerilog.\\n* **Asynchronous Reset:** The reset is implemented asynchronously (triggered by `posedge rst` in the `always_ff` block). This is a common and important design technique.  Make sure your FPGA/ASIC reset circuitry is designed to support this.\\n* **`always_comb` Block:** The combinational logic (calculating the next count value) is implemented using an `always_comb` block. This ensures that the `next_count` signal is updated whenever any of its inputs (in this case, `count`) change.  Crucially, this is *inside* the module itself.\\n* **Overflow Handling (Wrap-around):** The `always_comb` block now includes a check for counter overflow.  When the counter reaches its maximum value (`(1 << WIDTH) - 1`), it wraps around to 0.  This is important for many applications.\\n* **Testbench Structure:** The testbench (`counter_tb`) is well-structured:', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None, provider_specific_fields=None))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=1004, prompt_tokens=6, total_tokens=1010, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetailsWrapper(audio_tokens=None, cached_tokens=None, text_tokens=6, image_tokens=None)), vertex_ai_grounding_metadata=[], vertex_ai_url_context_metadata=[], vertex_ai_safety_results=[], vertex_ai_citation_metadata=[])\n",

Critically, it specifies what is returned when the list is empty.

If not, a `TypeError` is raised.\\n* **Handles Empty List:**  The code explicitly checks if the input list is empty using `if not numbers:`.  If it\\'s empty, it returns `0.0`.  This avoids a `ZeroDivisionError` and provides a sensible default return value for an empty input. This is best practice.\\n* **`if __name__ == \\'__main__\\':` block:** The example usage code is now inside an `if __name__ == \\'__main__\\':` block. This ensures that the example code only runs when the script is executed directly (e.g., `python your_script.py`) and not when the script is imported as a module into another script. This is standard Python practice.\\n* **Example Usage with Error Handling:** The example code now demonstrates how to use the function and also shows how to handle the `TypeError` exceptions that the function might raise.  This is crucial for showing how to use the function correctly and how to deal with potential errors.  The `try...except` blocks make the example much more complete and informative.\\n* **Clear Error Messages:** The `TypeError` exceptions now have descriptive messages that explain the problem.
